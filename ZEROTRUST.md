# CyberPAMZero Trust Network Access

TLDR: No more VPNs, just use Cloudflare Access to access your CyberPAM instance. Hosts no longer need to be in the same network, or have <b>any open ports.</b>

> Yes, CyberPAM and the host do NOT need to be in the same network.

## Setup Requirements

- Assumes you have a CyberPAM instance running already.
- Assumes you have a Cloudflare account and a domain. (free tier is fine)

## Settings Panel Fully Configured

When you having it it all setup, you should see something like this, notice the green globes.  This setup takes less than 15 minutes to complete.

> üí£ Notice red panel, once you set your domain, if you change it you will need to re-register the agents.

## Cloudflare ZTNA



>*The ZTNA module here works amazing well, however the setup isn't foolproof. Fill in the values and press save, then enable and the engine will start.*


### Add Catchall Policy

You need this policy to secure your hosts, and allow access to your CyberPAM instance.

### Get your Service Token

You'll need to strip off the CF-Header and CF-Key from the token, and then paste it into the CyberPAM settings panel.

### Setup API Access
Take note of the API key, account id, and email, you'll need to paste them into the CyberPAM settings panel. Your permissions should match these here.

![Example API token](media/ztapi.png)

You'll know its working when you see the green globe and your domains populate.

> If you don't see the green globes or the domains don't populate, you'll need to check your API key, account id, and email.

## Add Hosts

Lets add a host to our CyberPAM instance.

![system token](media/systoken.png)

Run the CyberPAM agent on the host, and provide this token. Within a few minutes you should see the host will be added to the list and the tunnel will show it's health under "expanded" view.
